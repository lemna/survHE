\title{Create an individual level dataset from digitised data}
\usage{
make.ipd(ipd_files, ctr = 1, var.labs = c("time", "event", "arm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{ipd_files}{a list including the names of the IPD files created as output of digitise}

\item{ctr}{the index of the file associated with the control arm (by default, the first file). 
This will be coded as 0}

\item{var.labs}{a vector of labels for the column of the resulting data matrix. These
should match the arguments to the formula specified for fit.models. The user can specify values.
These should be 4 elements (ID, TIME, EVENT, ARM)}
}
\value{
a dataframe
}
\description{
Piles in the simulated IPD resulting from running digitise for more than one treatment arm
